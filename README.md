# Kaggle-Titanic
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster


This was my first model using Python.
The objective of this model is just to familiarize with the basic tools available in Python regarding modeling.
There is not any special analysis in this notebook. 
This notebook is adequate if you are new to modeling in Python and want a quick pratical example with some basic functions.
However, the libraries used here are not the state of the art. For example, for decision trees it is better to use lightgbm, and for neural networks it is recomended PyTorch.
